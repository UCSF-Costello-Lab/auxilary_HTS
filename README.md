### Auxilary programs for HTS

This is a collection of simple scripts to do fast preprocessing on High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data. Most are written in C++ and depend on the [Bamtools](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools) and [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries.  These programs that are not specific for a project 
but produce something useful.
